The engine isn't complete yet. Here's what needs to be done:

- Expose the entire PhysicsFS structure via a metatable on ir.res
- Add matrix and vector math to Lua to properly work with quanternions
- Properly define inputs and put them on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for player accessibility and seamless input handling
- Allow a game to define a set of default player preferences
- Expand rendering to high-level constructs such as textures and models
- Document the publicly-facing Lua API for the engine
