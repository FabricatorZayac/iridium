The engine isn't complete yet. Here's what needs to be done:

- Expand rendering to high-level constructs such as textures and models
- Clean up and document the publicly-facing Lua API for the engine
- Clean up bind parsing/handling
- Add mouse/joystick support
- Determine the best way to handle audio
- Implement haptic feedback
