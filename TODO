The engine isn't complete yet. Here's what needs to be done:

- Properly define inputs and put them on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 for player accessibility and seamless input handling
- Expand rendering to high-level constructs such as textures and models
- Clean up and document the publicly-facing Lua API for the engine
